# Alien-Invasion
Pygame Project 

The Alien Invasion game consists in the battle of your ship with foreign wariors who want to kill you. If they reach your "front", then you will immediately die at the hands of the enemy. To survive, you need to destroy the entire enemy fleet by shooting at it (spacebar) and moving (left / right keys)

Until you have started the game, you can look at the statistics by pressing the F5 button, and you will be presented with a statistics window, and after closing this window, you will get a new game window and the appearance of the character and enemies can change there, this is done for greater interactivity .

You can also pause the game by pressing the ESC key.

For an emergency exit from the game with saving statistics, press the DEL key.

You can turn off the sound by setting the sounds setting to False, and you can also adjust the volume by setting the sounds_volume variable from 0 to 100 (initially 25)
